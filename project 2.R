#Interpretation of data:
#there is a negative correlation between kilometers drove and selling price, so more driving in kilometers the lower the selling price
#weak negative correlation between mileage and selling price, as the mileage increases, the selling price goes down
#as the engine power increases, the value of the car goes up
#max power is strongly positive correlated with selling price, so the higher max power, the higher the selling price
#as year increases, the selling price increases, which means newer cars sell at a higher price
#the max power and engine are strongly positive correlated, so as max power increases, the engine power increases, these cars also tend to be younger as year and max power are low positive correlated
